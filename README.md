# To Do List

A mobile application built using Flutter and Dart that communicates with the To Do API provided by Swagger and allows users to view, add, updated, and delete items from their to do list, as well as toggle between light and dark mode.

## Features

The To-Do List app offers the following features:

1. **View To-Do List**: Upon opening the app, users are presented with their to-do list on the home page. Each task item displays important details such as the task title and description.

2. **Add New To-Do**: To add a new to-do task, users can navigate to the "Add New To Do" page by clicking on the floating action button (FAB) present on the home page. This allows for quick and easy creation of new tasks.

3. **Edit and Delete To-Do**: The app provides users with the ability to edit or delete an existing to-do task directly from the home page. By tapping on the popup menu button at the end of each to-do list item tile, users can access options to edit the task details or remove it from their list.

4. **Light and Dark Mode**: The app includes a toggle button located on the right side of the app bar, allowing users to switch between light and dark mode based on their preference. This feature enhances user experience by adapting to different lighting conditions and personal preferences.
